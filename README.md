## 🚀 Features

### 🔑 User Authentication
- Routes for user login, registration, and session management.

### 💕 Swipe Mechanics
- Allows users to interact with potential matches.
- Optimized using **Redis** for caching swipe data and enhancing performance.

### 👤 Profile Management

### ⭐ Upgrade Services
- Handles premium features or in-app enhancements via dedicated routes.

### 🩺 Health Check
- A `/health` endpoint to monitor application readiness and status.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Go (Golang)**: The core programming language, chosen for its speed and scalability.
- **Redis**: Used for caching dynamic data like swipe interactions.
- **SQL Database** (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Persistent storage for user data and settings.
- **Gorilla Mux**: A router library for clean and organized API endpoint management.
- **Custom Middleware**: Handles additional request/response processes such as logging and authentication.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed through a custom `dotenv` package.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Handler-Based Structure**:
   - Clean separation of concerns for each feature (e.g., `Swipe`, `Auth`, `Profile`).
   - Grouped and organized routes for modularity.

2. **Custom Redis Client**:
   - `redis.RedisClient` is initialized at application startup and shared across handlers.

3. **Database Initialization**:
   - A dedicated initialization process (`db.Conn()`) ensures reliable database connections.

4. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - Resources like Redis connections are cleaned up during server shutdown.
